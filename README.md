## What is Neon Disk VR?
Neon Disk VR is a simple puzzle game where you throw a tron themed discus at targets in virtual reality in order to gain points whilst also trying to get the disk into the goal.

## Programming Goal

 1. Get everything under correct namespaces.
 2. Reduce unneeded **using** to reduce build time.
 3. Refactor all code into proper naming conventions with lots of comments/summaries.
 4. Proper serialization and tool tipping.
 5. Ordering all folders into scene based scenarios so we do not mix up objects.
